# Changelog

## 0.20.0 — knowledge readiness contracts

### Added

- First-class knowledge-readiness contracts: `KnowledgeRequirement`,
  `KnowledgeBundle`, `KnowledgeReadinessReport`, `UserQuestion`, and
  `DataAcquisitionPlan`.
- `scoreKnowledgeReadiness`, `blockingKnowledgeEval`,
  `userQuestionsForKnowledgeGaps`, and `acquisitionPlansForKnowledgeGaps`.
- Knowledge/data failure classes including `knowledge_readiness_blocked`,
  `missing_credentials`, `bad_retrieval`, `insufficient_evidence`, and
  `contradictory_evidence`.
- `docs/knowledge-readiness.md`, plus documented knowledge-related ASI
  responsible surfaces for multi-shot optimization.

## 0.19.1 — release confidence gate

### Added

- `evaluateReleaseConfidence`, a conservative release scorecard over corpus
  coverage, search/holdout run evidence, ASI diagnostics, overfit checks, and
  cost/latency budgets.
- `assertReleaseConfidence`, a throwing variant for CI/release scripts.
- `releaseTraceEvidenceFromMultiShotTrials`, a helper that projects
  `MultiShotTrialResult` rows into release trace evidence so single-shot and
  variable multi-shot apps use the same release gate.

## 0.19.0 — legacy optimizer removal

### Removed

- Removed the legacy pairwise prompt optimizer surface:
  `PromptOptimizer`, `OptimizationLoop`, and their associated root-exported
  types are gone. The blessed optimization path is now
  `runMultiShotOptimization` for task trajectories and the steering-specific
  optimizers for explicit steering tables.
- Removed the old `PromptVariant` root export. Public callers should use
  `MultiShotVariant` for multi-shot trajectory optimization or
  `EvolvableVariant` for the lower-level prompt/code evolution core.

### Changed

- Documentation now points optimization users at `runMultiShotOptimization`
  instead of the removed pairwise prompt optimizer.

## 0.18.0 — multi-shot optimization

### Added

- `runMultiShotOptimization`, the canonical GEPA-style adapter for
  variable-length agent trajectories. It wraps `runPromptEvolution` while
  preserving full multi-shot traces, actionable side information, stable paired
  seeds, score/cost objectives, and optional held-out promotion gating.
- `trialTraceFromMultiShotTrial`, a bridge from multi-shot trial results into
  reflective mutation prompts.
- `ActionableSideInfo`, `MultiShotVariant`, `MultiShotTrace`, `MultiShotRun`,
  `MultiShotScore`, `MultiShotTrialResult`, `MultiShotMutateAdapter`, and
  related public types.
- `docs/multi-shot-optimization.md` and
  `examples/multi-shot-optimization/index.ts`.

### Changed

- The multi-shot result shape explicitly separates `searchBestVariant` from
  `promotedVariant`. If a holdout gate rejects the search winner, the promoted
  variant is the baseline.
- `runMultiShotOptimization` validates release-critical configuration up front:
  unique variant/scenario ids, positive integer run counts, population size,
  disjoint search/holdout ids, and a gate baseline key matching the first seed
  variant.

## 0.17.2 — agent control runtime

### Added

- `runAgentControlLoop`, a generic `observe -> validate -> decide -> act`
  runtime for agentic tasks with step, wall-clock, and recorded-cost budgets;
  no-progress and repeated-action stop policies; structured runtime failures;
  objective/subjective eval helpers; and `TraceStore` emission.
- `runProposeReviewAsControlLoop`, a bridge preset that expresses
  propose/verify/review as a specialization of the generic control runtime.
- feedback trajectory helpers for turning control-loop runs and user/judge
  labels into reusable dataset scenarios, optimizer rows, and preference
  memory.
- `docs/control-runtime.md`, with integration patterns for tax, legal,
  agent-builder, and film-agent products.

### Changed

- control runtime trace sink and `onStep` callback failures are now recorded
  as structured runtime errors without aborting an otherwise valid run.
- `runProposeReviewAsControlLoop` accepts a caller-provided verifier failure
  mapper for domain-specific failure classes.

## 0.17.0 — surface cleanup + SKILL pitfalls

This release tightens the public benchmark surface and lands the SKILL.md guidance that the v0.15 dispatch couldn't write.

### Moved

- `src/benchmarks/gsm8k/` → `examples/benchmarks/gsm8k/`
- `src/benchmarks/swebench-lite/` → `examples/benchmarks/swebench-lite/`

These are reference implementations of `BenchmarkAdapter`, not core surface. Consumers read them, copy them, adapt them. The novel `routing` benchmark stays in `src/benchmarks/` because it's our own and broadly useful.

`src/benchmarks/index.ts` now exports the shared types + the `routing` benchmark only. The previous `gsm8k` and `swebenchLite` namespace exports are gone — import directly from `examples/benchmarks/<name>/index.ts` (or copy the wrapper into your own project).

### Added

- `examples/benchmarks/README.md` documents how to use, copy, and extend the example wrappers.
- `.claude/skills/agent-eval/SKILL.md` gains a "Production-rigor primitives (v0.16+)" section and a "Pitfalls" section with 13 footgun directives covering the v0.16 primitives. (Couldn't be written in v0.15 due to harness sandbox; landed in v0.17.)

### Migration

If you imported `gsm8k` or `swebenchLite` from `@tangle-network/agent-eval/benchmarks`:

```ts
// before
import { gsm8k, swebenchLite } from '@tangle-network/agent-eval/benchmarks'

// after — copy the file from examples/benchmarks/<name>/index.ts into your project,
// or import via relative path from the cloned repo.
```

The `routing` benchmark and the shared `BenchmarkAdapter` types are unchanged.

## 0.16.0 — naming cleanup

The v0.15 primitives were framed as "paper-grade" but most are production-rigor utilities any team needs. This release renames the three reporting helpers and drops the "paper" framing from the public API. Behavior unchanged.

### Renamed

- `paperTable` → `summaryTable`
- `paretoFigure` → `paretoChart`
- `gainDistributionFigure` → `gainHistogram`
- `PaperTable` / `PaperTableOptions` / `PaperTableRow` types → `SummaryTable` / `SummaryTableOptions` / `SummaryTableRow`
- File: `src/paper-report.ts` → `src/summary-report.ts`

### Migration

Drop-in: search-and-replace the three function names and the file path. Type names follow the same pattern. No behavior change.

```ts
// before
import { paperTable, paretoFigure, gainDistributionFigure } from '@tangle-network/agent-eval'
// after
import { summaryTable, paretoChart, gainHistogram } from '@tangle-network/agent-eval'
```

## 0.15.0 — paper-grade primitives

Substrate for the "Two Loops, Three Roles" paper on multi-level prompt
optimization with held-out promotion gates.

### Added

- **`HeldOutGate`** (`src/promotion-gate.ts`) — first-class held-out
  paired-delta promotion gate. Three checks: minimum productive runs,
  positive lower bound on bootstrap CI of paired holdout median delta,
  bounded overfit-gap relative to baseline. Decisions carry a
  machine-readable `rejectionCode` (`few_runs` | `negative_delta` |
  `overfit_gap`) plus an `evidence` block with every number the gate
  read. Generalizes the inline pattern that lived in
  `redteam/scripts/agent-eval-autoresearch.ts:138–171`.
- **`RunRecord`** (`src/run-record.ts`) — paper-grade JSON-friendly run
  schema with mandatory fields: `runId`, `experimentId`, `candidateId`,
  `seed`, snapshot-versioned `model`, `promptHash`, `configHash`,
  `commitSha`, `wallMs`, `costUsd`, `tokenUsage`, `outcome`, `splitTag`.
  Runtime validator (`validateRunRecord`, `isRunRecord`,
  `parseRunRecordSafe`, `roundTripRunRecord`) throws on missing fields
  and on bare model aliases without snapshot suffix.
- **`Researcher`** (`src/researcher.ts`) — stable hook for an
  autonomous-research agent: `inspectFailures` → `proposeChange` →
  `applyChange` → `evaluateChange`. `NoopResearcher` is the
  fail-loud placeholder. Implementations live downstream.
- **Reference benchmarks** (`src/benchmarks/`) — three adapters that
  share the `BenchmarkAdapter<TItem, TPayload>` shape:
  - `gsm8k`: HF-mirror loader (JSONL via `AGENT_EVAL_GSM8K_PATH`),
    exact-match grading via `parseGsm8kAnswer`.
  - `swebench-lite`: 30-instance subset stub. Loader reads
    `AGENT_EVAL_SWEBENCH_PATH`; grader shells out to
    `AGENT_EVAL_SWEBENCH_GRADER_CMD`. Both fail loud when unset.
  - `routing`: synthetic 16-task router benchmark, ships in the
    package, dependency-free. Format documented in
    `src/benchmarks/routing/README.md`.
  - `deterministicSplit(itemId, seed?)`: stable 60/20/20 split via
    FNV-1a hash. Default seed `agent-eval-v1`.
- **`summaryTable`, `paretoChart`, `gainHistogram`**
  (`sr./summary-report.ts`) — Table 1 + Pareto + gain-distribution specs.
  Returns data structures (markdown table, point lists, histogram bins);
  caller picks the plotting library.
- **`runCanaries`** (`src/canary.ts`) — three liveness canaries:
  silent judge fallback (consecutive constant-confidence streak),
  judge calibration drift (KS test on confidence distribution), eval-set
  distribution shift (chi-square on category bucket counts).
- **`pairedBootstrap`, `pairedWilcoxon`, `bhAdjust`**
  (`src/paired-stats.ts`) — paper-style aliases + the missing paired
  bootstrap CI primitive. Deterministic with optional seed.

### Notes

- No breaking changes. Every existing module is untouched; new types
  are additive.
- All new public symbols carry JSDoc.
- 87 new tests across 7 new test files. 571 total tests pass.
- See `.claude/skills/agent-eval/SKILL.md` for usage directives and
  pitfalls; `## Pitfalls` section added in this release.
