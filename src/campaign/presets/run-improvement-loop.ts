/**
 * `runImprovementLoop` — the gated-promotion shell around the improvement
 * loop body (`runOptimization`). Proposes candidate surfaces via the
 * `SurfaceProposer`, re-scores the winner against the baseline on a
 * holdout set, runs the release gate, and optionally opens a PR.
 *
 * Role vocabulary (see docs/design/loop-taxonomy.md):
 *   - PROPOSER   = the `SurfaceProposer` (evolutionary GEPA mutator OR
 *                  reflective analyst). Proposes candidate SURFACES — the
 *                  worker's system prompt / tool config — NOT conversation
 *                  turns.
 *   - MEASUREMENT= `runCampaign`. Scores one surface by running the worker
 *                  (via `dispatch`) over scenarios and judging the output.
 *   - WORKER     = the agent harness in the sandbox, invoked behind the
 *                  topology-opaque `dispatch` seam — never referenced here.
 *
 * Distinct from `runLoop` in `@tangle-network/agent-runtime`, which is the
 * INNER conversation loop (execution driver ↔ workers in a sandbox). `runImprovementLoop`
 * is the OUTER loop: it improves the surface that those workers run.
 *
 * Hard-refuses unsafe configurations:
 *   - `tracing: 'off'` when a proposer is wired (improvement is unattributable)
 *   - `autoOnPromote: 'config'` — DEFERRED to Pass B; v0.40 only ships
 *     `'pr'` and `'none'`.
